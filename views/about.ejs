        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My family has always been used to having fresh pasta around. For almost any special occasion, my Nonna would
            make delicious pasta by hand for all of us to enjoy. A few years ago I started to learn how to make it myself, 
            starting first with simple shapes like tagliatelle and learning more over time. Last year I had the idea to 
            start selling pasta and pastries to friends from school, mostly through my social media pages, but now I'm 
            hoping to grow my idea even more!
